      <P>Hi, I'm Anmol. I go by nhooyr on the internet.</P>
      <P>I'm a software engineer from Toronto (now Kaslo, BC).</P>
      <P>I'm a self taught engineer. I didn't attend university and I didn't graduate high school.</P>
      <P>
        In July, 2017, at the end of my junior year of high school I became employed as a
        full time engineer at <Link href="https://coder.com">Coder</Link>. As I was able
        to attain gainful employment while I was 17, I felt there was no need for me to
        continue schooling and so I dropped out during my first month of senior year.
      </P>

        I believe there's little valuable information you cannot learn by yourself because
        it all comes down to some sequence of NANDs (or more intuitively ANDs and ORs).
        It's actually how I check myself to see whether I've understood something. I try
        to break it down into its most fundamental statements and realize its axioms.

        To be clear, I don't think self education is a pancea. There are trade offs. I've
        certainly suffered from the negative consequences. Nonetheless I think I have and
        will benefit overall. People often tell me I'm taking a short cut but I'm looking
        30 years out, not 5 or 10.
      </P>
      <P>
        The greatest factor in my success as an engineer has been my own passion,
        initiative and focus. However, the incredible volume of quality reading available
        on websites, blogs and forums has contributed immensely. For at least the last 8
        years, the internet has been my primary means of education.
      </P>
      <P>I wish to contribute back.</P>
      <P>
        On this blog you can expect to find quality writings about software, philosophy,
        life and everything in between.
      </P>
      <P>
        I'll be taking my time though. I have no intention of adding more noise to the world.
