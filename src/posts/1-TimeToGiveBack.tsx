      <P>Hi, I'm Anmol. I go by nhooyr on the internet. I'm a software engineer from Toronto.</P>
      <P>I'm a self taught engineer. I didn't attend university and I didn't graduate high school.</P>
      <P>
        In July, 2017, at the end of my junior year of high school I became employed as a full time engineer at{" "}
        <Link href="https://coder.com">Coder</Link>. As I was able to gain employment during high school, I felt there
        was no need for me to continue schooling and so I promptly dropped out.
      </P>
      <P>
        The greatest factor in my success as an engineer has been my own passion, initiative and focus. However, the
        incredible volume of quality reading available on websites, blogs and forums has contributed immensely. For at
        least the last 8 years, the internet has been my primary means of education.
      </P>
      <P>It's time for me to contribute back.</P>
      <P>
        On this blog you can expect to find quality writings about software, philosophy, life and everything in between.
        There will never be <i>any</i> ads, popups or bullshit.
      </P>
      <P>This blog is well engineered and one of my first posts will be to justify its inner workings.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope my efforts with this blog are successful in giving back.</P>
